This node command-line utility can be used to count total number of stars and forks for a user. For example, to count total number of stars and forks for shekhargulati (i.e. me) you can run the following command.

```
$ npm install -g gh-stats
```

```javascript
$ gh-stats shekhargulati
```

```
shekhargulati has 232 public repositories as of 9/5/2017, 3:57:42 PM
Total Stars: 13090
Total Forks: 2496
```


This is a fork of [starcounter.js gist](https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/7745157) created by [yyx990803](https://github.com/yyx990803). I modified it to support forks as well.
